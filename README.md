# LoginSystemInC
it have different libraries, macros, functions, structure, file handling, conditional statements, loops and many more.  
i have used some of the basic but underrated commands like sleep, beep, also made user defined functions goto function to move cursor at a specific coordinate on the command prompt, 
generates username on it's own using provided email and tried to make it little bit animated using for loops. 
so basically this project is best for beginners so i recommend all those people who are beginner like me in C programming or any other programming language.
you can take this project as reference and make your own project in your favorite language.


#NOTE
i have used DEV C++ IDE to code this project so i am not sure it will work on other IDEs too. i have tried to run this very same code on VS code but it didn't work and pop up some errors. so yeah heads up for that and i know even if you use different IDE you will make it run. 

BEST OF LUCK GUYS AND I WILL KEEP POSTING BASIC PROJECTS LIKE THIS ONE SO MAKE SURE YOU CHECK HAHAHA AND I NEED FEEDBACKS TOO SO YEAH YOU CAN MESSAGE ME IN FACEBOOK AND LET ME KNOW MY FLAWS AND SUGGESTIONS.
